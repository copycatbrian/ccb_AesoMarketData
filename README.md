# ccb_AesoMarketData


Welcome to the Aeso market data project.  Most likely this is end up as a data science tutorial on how to analyze the Alberta electricity market: AESO.  My hope is that I can push some data science in the electricity market to the public domain.  It's not much, but maybe I can lower some friction to looking at power development in Alberta.  

Feel free to message me if you have questions or just want to discuss power analysis.
